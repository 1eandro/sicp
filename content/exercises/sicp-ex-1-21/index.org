This is the 21 first question from Sicp and I feel this exercise is very
simple compared to the others after this.

*Exercise 1.21*: Use the =smallest-divisor= procedure to find the
smallest divisor of each of the following numbers: 199, 1999, 19999

This question is quite simple: Evaluate this code in a REPL.

So here's the code for =smallest-divisor=:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (define (smallest-divisor n)
    (find-divisor n 2))

  (define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
    (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) n)
      ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
      (else (find-divisor n (+ test-divisor 1)))))

  (define (divides? a b)
    (= (remainder b a) 0))
#+END_SRC

Here's the evaluation:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (smallest-divisor 199)

  ;Value: 199

  1 (user) => (smallest-divisor 1999)

  ;Value: 1999

  1 (user) => (smallest-divisor 19999)

  ;Value: 7
#+END_SRC

A quick google search proves all these answers are correct.

I think this was the most easiest exercise yet.
